## Project Components

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   Collect raw data from various sources into Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery.

2. **Data Transformation and Curation (with dbt):**  
   Use **dbt** to clean, transform, and curate the data for downstream processes.

3. **API and Microservice Development (FastAPI):**  
   Develop APIs and microservices using **FastAPI** to serve data and insights.

4. **A/B Testing Analysis:**  
   Perform A/B testing on experimental and control groups to measure campaign effectiveness.

5. **Forecasting Campaign Performance:**  
   Build predictive models to forecast future campaign performance using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.

6. **Dashboard Visualization in Looker:**  
   Create interactive dashboards with **Looker** for real-time visualization of key metrics.

7. **Deployment to Google Cloud:**  
   Deploy the entire pipeline using Google Cloud services like **GKE**, **BigQuery**, and **Cloud Storage**.
